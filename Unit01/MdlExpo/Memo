Steps for Applying f-k Analysis to Cross-Correlation Results
1. Obtain Cross-Correlation Results

    Calculate Cross-Correlation: As mentioned earlier, compute the cross-correlation between the time series recorded by pairs of sensors. After stacking the cross-correlation functions over time, you will obtain a coherent signal that mainly contains surface waves at specific frequencies.
    The result will be a time-domain function for each sensor pair, representing the apparent travel time of seismic waves between the two sensors.

2. Convert Cross-Correlation to the Frequency Domain

    Fourier Transform: Apply the Fourier Transform (typically Fast Fourier Transform or FFT) to the cross-correlation function to convert it into the frequency domain. This will give you the spectral content of the signal, which contains information about the frequency of the surface waves.

    For each cross-correlation function C(t)C(t), compute the Fourier transform:
    C^(f)=∫C(t)⋅e−i2πftdt
    C^(f)=∫C(t)⋅e−i2πftdt

    where ff is the frequency.

    This will produce a frequency spectrum that can be analyzed for dominant frequencies.

3. Calculate the Wavenumber (k)

    Travel Time and Distance: For each frequency, use the apparent travel time between the sensor pair and the distance between the sensors to calculate the wavenumber (k). The wavenumber is related to the phase velocity vv of the surface waves and the frequency ff by the equation:
    k=2πfv
    k=v2πf​

    where vv is the phase velocity (which can be estimated from the time delay between sensors) and ff is the frequency of the surface wave.

    For each frequency, you will calculate the corresponding wavenumber for the sensor pair.

4. Apply f-k Transform

    After obtaining the frequency and wavenumber information for each sensor pair, organize the data in a grid, where the x-axis represents the wavenumber (k) and the y-axis represents the frequency (f). This is your f-k domain.

    f-k Spectrum: Construct a 2D spectrum by plotting the frequency (f) against the wavenumber (k) values. The surface waves (typically Rayleigh waves in passive seismic studies) will form a distinct linear or elliptical pattern in the f-k domain. This is because surface wave energy propagates with a characteristic relationship between frequency and wavenumber (dispersion).

    You can visualize the f-k spectrum, where:
        Surface waves will form a line or curve in the spectrum, as their velocity is dispersive (dependent on frequency).
        Body waves and noise will often appear as distinct features in the f-k plot, but they are typically easier to separate because their dispersion characteristics differ from surface waves.

5. Interpret the Dispersion Curve

    Once you have the f-k spectrum, you can trace the dispersion curve. The surface waves (e.g., Rayleigh waves) will show a clear, identifiable slope in the f-k plot, which indicates the relationship between frequency and wavenumber (i.e., phase velocity).

    The dispersion curve provides the phase velocity at different frequencies, which is the key to determining the shear-wave velocity structure of the subsurface.

6. Extract the Phase Velocity and Build the Dispersion Curve

    From the f-k spectrum, pick the phase velocity values corresponding to different frequencies. You can extract the phase velocity (often denoted v(ω)v(ω) or v(f)v(f)) from the slope of the surface wave in the f-k domain.

    Plot the dispersion curve, which shows the variation of phase velocity with frequency. The dispersion curve will often be non-linear, and the shape of the curve can help identify the characteristics of different subsurface layers.

7. Inversion of the Dispersion Curve

    Once you have the dispersion curve, you can invert it to obtain the shear-wave velocity (Vs) profile of the subsurface using various inversion methods (e.g., non-linear inversion, least-squares fitting, or Monte Carlo inversion).

    The inversion process matches the observed dispersion curve to a theoretical model of the subsurface, allowing you to derive the shear-wave velocity profile as a function of depth.

Key Points to Remember

    Wavenumber Calculation: The wavenumber depends on the distance between sensors and the phase velocity of the surface waves. Using the apparent travel time between sensor pairs and their distance, you can calculate the wavenumber for each frequency.

    Surface Wave Identification: Surface waves are characterized by their dispersive nature, and they form a distinct pattern in the f-k spectrum. By tracking these waves, you can isolate them from other seismic events or noise.

    Frequency and Wavelength: The frequency range of interest will depend on the depth of investigation. Lower frequencies penetrate deeper, while higher frequencies provide more detailed information about shallow layers.

    Noise Separation: f-k analysis helps you isolate surface waves from noise by identifying their specific dispersion characteristics. Typically, surface waves will dominate in the f-k domain, but noise (such as body waves or cultural noise) can be separated based on its different dispersion characteristics.

By applying f-k analysis to your cross-correlation results, you can effectively extract and analyze surface waves, which are critical for mapping subsurface shear-wave velocity profiles and other geophysical characteristics of the Earth’s crust.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Preparation:

    Collect the seismic data from all stations in the array. The data should ideally be pre-processed (filtered and normalized) to isolate the Rayleigh wave signal, often within a frequency range of interest.
    Apply time-domain windows or tapering (e.g., cosine taper) to reduce edge effects and noise.

2. Compute the f-k Spectra:

For each station pair (i.e., between stations A and B):

    Fourier Transform the time-domain signals from both stations to obtain their frequency-domain data.
    Compute the cross-spectral density (CSD) or auto-spectral density for each frequency component. This helps identify the energy distribution over wavenumber (k) and frequency (f).
    f-k Transformation: Perform the Fourier transform of the cross-correlation or the spatial correlation between the two stations to obtain the f-k spectra. This gives you information about the wavenumber and frequency of the wave components, helping to identify the phase velocities at different frequencies.

S(f,k)=∫∫x(t)⋅y(t)⋅e−i2π(ft−kx)dtdx
S(f,k)=∫∫x(t)⋅y(t)⋅e−i2π(ft−kx)dtdx

where:

    x(t)x(t) and y(t)y(t) are the signals from the two stations,
    ff is the frequency,
    kk is the wavenumber.

3. Identify Rayleigh Wave Energy:

    From the f-k spectra, identify the Rayleigh wave signal based on the dispersion relation (Rayleigh waves have specific characteristics in the f-k domain). You’ll typically look for a linear relationship between frequency and wavenumber in the lower-frequency range, corresponding to Rayleigh wave propagation.
    Use the phase velocity vp=f/kvp​=f/k, which can be extracted from the dominant peaks in the f-k spectrum.

4. Estimate Phase Velocity Dispersion Curve:

For each station pair:

    Determine the phase velocity vp(f)vp​(f) at different frequencies by identifying the peak of the f-k spectrum at each frequency.
    Construct a phase velocity dispersion curve by plotting phase velocity vpvp​ against frequency ff. This curve represents the dispersion of Rayleigh waves for the array.

5. Combine the Results from All Pairs of Stations:

    Average the phase velocity estimates from all the station pairs. This can be done by taking the mean of the phase velocities at each frequency across all pairs. This helps to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of the dispersion curve.
    If you have multiple pairs of stations, you will get multiple estimates for the phase velocity at each frequency, so you can average them to obtain a more robust and precise dispersion curve.

vp(f)=1N∑i=1Nvp,i(f)
vp​(f)=N1​i=1∑N​vp,i​(f)

where NN is the number of station pairs and vp,i(f)vp,i​(f) is the phase velocity from the ii-th pair at frequency ff.
6. Invert the Dispersion Curve to Estimate the S-velocity Profile:

Once you have the dispersion curve of phase velocities, you can invert it to estimate the subsurface shear wave velocity profile Vs(z)Vs​(z). This inversion can be performed using techniques like:

    Least-squares inversion,
    Monte Carlo methods,
    Bayesian inversion, or any other method suited for surface wave tomography.

You will need a model that describes how the Rayleigh wave phase velocity varies with depth in the Earth (e.g., a layered model).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sensitivity of Each Station Pair to Different Rayleigh Wave Paths:

    The Rayleigh waves recorded at each pair of stations will have slightly different propagation paths and different sensitivities to the subsurface structure, depending on the distance between the stations and their relative positions to the source.
    In a circular array, station pairs that are closer to each other will likely be more sensitive to the near-surface structures, while pairs that are farther apart will primarily sample deeper layers. The source distribution being diffuse means that the sources of seismic energy are spread across the area, leading to variable propagation paths that sample different portions of the subsurface.

Effect: When you combine dispersion curves from all pairs of sensors, the resulting stacked dispersion curve could mix information from different depths and lateral variations in the earth's structure.
2. Diffuse Source Distribution:

    With a diffuse source distribution, the sources of Rayleigh waves are not coming from a single point but are distributed across the area surrounding the array. This leads to seismic waves traveling from different directions and interacting with the subsurface at various angles.
    Since Rayleigh waves have a non-unique propagation behavior in different azimuthal directions (especially in heterogeneous or laterally varying media), the dispersion curves derived from pairs of sensors might not always be consistent and could reflect different spatial scales or portions of the model.

Effect: Each station pair, depending on its orientation relative to the sources, will capture different Rayleigh wave characteristics (such as phase velocity) depending on the slowness (wave velocity) structure beneath the array.
3. Mixing of Different Earth Models:

    The dispersion curve derived from the f-k analysis reflects the Rayleigh wave phase velocity at different frequencies. If pairs of stations are sensitive to different subsurface structures (due to their different locations and orientations), the stacked dispersion curve could be influenced by different layers or lateral variations in the Earth’s properties.
    In practice, this means that when you average or stack the dispersion curves from all station pairs, you may inadvertently mix information from different depths or lateral heterogeneities in the Earth’s structure, leading to a more complex and less homogeneous model after inversion.

Effect: This blending of signals could lead to ambiguities in the depth resolution and might compromise the uniqueness of the final inverted shear wave velocity profile. The resulting model may not fully represent the real subsurface structure in a straightforward way, as the sensitivity kernels of the different pairs can be weighted differently toward various depths or regions.
4. Inversion Complexity:

    When you perform the inversion of the dispersion curve, especially in the case of a circular array, the different station pairs provide information from different depths and lateral positions. The inversion method assumes that the dispersion curve represents a homogeneous or smoothly varying model of the subsurface, but due to the different sensitivities of each station pair, this assumption can be violated.
    The inversion will likely attempt to fit the average dispersion curve derived from all station pairs, but the depth sensitivity and the lateral heterogeneity can lead to non-unique solutions or a model that doesn't perfectly match the actual structure.

Strategies to Mitigate Mixing:

    Weighting the Pairs: To mitigate the issue of mixing diverse models, you can assign weights to the station pairs based on their sensitivity to depth or source-receiver geometry. Pairs that sample similar depths or lateral regions could be given more weight, helping to reduce the influence of pairs that sample different structures.

    Source Location Consideration: If possible, you could account for the azimuthal variation of the sources when stacking the dispersion curves. This could involve grouping station pairs that sample similar source regions or using ray tracing to model the contributions of different source-receiver paths more accurately.

    Advanced Inversion Techniques: Some advanced methods of inversion, such as non-linear inversion or multi-frequency inversion, are designed to account for lateral heterogeneity and depth-dependent sensitivity. These methods can help reduce the ambiguity when using multiple station pairs from a circular array with a diffuse source distribution.

    Separate Analysis by Station Group: If possible, you could group stations based on their distance from the center of the array and analyze different subsets of station pairs separately, with each group focusing on a different depth range. Afterward, the separate models could be integrated with careful consideration of the spatial coverage and depth sensitivity of each group.
